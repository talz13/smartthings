## Features

The Wireless Sensor Tags integration connects securely to your www.mytaglist.com account securely using OAuth2. Once attached, the SmartApp gets a list of the tags you have in your account. You can then choose which tags you want to create as SmartThings devices. The  SmartApp currently creates the devices as a Motion Device Type or a Water Device Type.

Generic Device Features:

* Temperature 
* Humidity (shows as zero on tags that don't support humidity)
* Wet/Dry
* Illuminance
* Refresh & Poll
* Battery Level

Other tag types will be created as Motion Devices and should support whatever functionality they have in common with the motion tags. 

The majority of the tuning you can do on www.mytaglist.com will apply while you have the tags enabled as part of ST. Tuning options like responsiveness, sensitivity, and threshold angle may improve responsiveness or fuctionality in ST as well. Note that the ST integration overwrites many of the option in the "URL Calling..." dialog and arms/disarms the tags.
